Suicide is one of leading causes of death worldwide,
yet little data is available about the lives of suicide victims
because most people do not seek treatment. Research has shown
that people express suicidal ideation in social media, which
can potentially be tapped to improve our understanding of the
thoughts and behaviors of people prior to suicide. In this work,
we introduce a novel dataset of Chinese social media accounts
of 130 people who committed suicide between 2011 and 2016.
We describe the demographic and geographic composition of
the users, then conduct a longitudinal text analysis of their post
histories, showing observable changes in content leading up to
the time of death. With encouraging exploratory findings, we
discuss directions for future research.
