* We describe a preprocessing step that allows the inclusion of non-textual discrete features (e.g., followers, locations) into off-the-shelf text embedding methods. Our method is easy to use, requiring no special implementation.
* We introduce a novel type of feature for user embeddings---the geographic locations of users' friends---and show that this improves performance over standard text and network features on a new Twitter dataset.
* We find that jointly modeling all types of features improves performance over combining independent models of different feature sets, offering evidence that there are informative interactions between text content and metadata, and demonstrating that simply combining independent models is insufficient.
